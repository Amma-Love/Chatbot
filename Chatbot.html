"Amma's‑Love is a student‑run service that uses AI and prompt engineering to build fast, affordable websites and simple AI chatbots for small businesses, tutors, clinics, salons, and freelancers.\n\nThe goal is to give small businesses a clean online presence and basic automation at a fraction of typical agency pricing, while still keeping quality and speed very high."

"Right now Amma's‑Love focuses on three main services:\n\n1) Websites – landing pages, portfolio sites, and small business/shop/clinic/tuition websites.\n2) Simple AI chatbots – FAQ bots that answer common questions and capture leads.\n3) Design add‑ons – basic posters, social media creatives, or simple brochures generated with AI and refined manually.\n\nEverything is designed to be fast, affordable, and easy for you to maintain."

"Typical Indian market pricing for websites ranges from a few thousand rupees for very basic sites up to ₹50,000 or more for custom work, and e‑commerce projects can go even higher.\n\nAmma's‑Love intentionally stays on the lower side using AI tools, templates, and a lean workflow. The goals are:\n• Be affordable for small/local businesses.\n• Build portfolio and case studies.\n• Still keep strong margins by saving development time."

"Chatbots are usually billed as a monthly subscription because they run continuously and may need updates:\n\n• Basic FAQ chatbot: can start in the few hundred rupees per month range during a promo (for example around ₹299/month).\n• Regular basic pricing outside promos is more like ₹1,000+/month depending on integrations and traffic.\n\nThe idea is to keep it affordable compared to the time and effort it saves you."

"Typical delivery targets (if content is ready):\n\n• Simple landing page: about 2 days.\n• Portfolio or small business site: about 3–5 days.\n• Basic FAQ chatbot: 1–3 days once questions/answers are agreed.\n\nLarger or more customized work can take longer, but speed is a priority and timelines are discussed clearly before starting."

"Common payment structure:\n\n• Websites: 50% advance to start, 50% after final approval but before going fully live on your main domain.\n• Chatbots: usually paid monthly in advance (for example on the 1st of every month).\n• Payment options: UPI or payment links (and bank transfer if needed).\n\nExact terms are clearly agreed before work begins."

        answer:
"Reasonable revisions are included, especially in the first version:\n\n• Content edits (text, photos, colors) are usually fine in the first 1–2 revision rounds.\n• Structural changes (new sections, pages, or complex features) may increase price or delivery time.\n\nThe aim is always to keep it fair: clear scope, clear price, and a site you are happy with."

        answer:
"Amma's‑Love leans heavily on modern tools:\n\n• AI (prompt engineering with large language models) to generate and refine content and front‑end code.\n• Modern web hosting platforms for fast, secure static sites.\n• Simple bot platforms or custom flows for FAQ‑style chatbots.\n\nThis keeps development time short and pricing low while still giving you modern, responsive websites."

        answer:
"Amma's‑Love is run by students who are still in school and serious about their studies.\n\nThe business is designed to fit around school by:\n• Focusing on small, well‑defined projects.\n• Batching most work into evenings and weekends.\n• Using AI tools to save manual time.\n\nClients still get professional‑quality work, but at friendlier prices, because overhead is low and the team is lean."
